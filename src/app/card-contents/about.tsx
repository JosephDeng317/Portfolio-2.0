          I'm Joseph, a passionate fullstack developer with more than 5 years 
          of programming experience and skilled in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. 
          Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Physics at the University Of British Columbia, 
          where I am in my second year. When I'm not coding, you may find me fiddling with my piano or guitar, 
          at the gym trying to hit a new PR, or immersing myself in the beautiful nature surrounding Vancouver.
