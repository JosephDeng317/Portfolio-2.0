          Nice to meet you! I'm Joseph, a passionate fullstack developer with more than 6 years 
          of programming experience in various languages. I began my journey learning the fundementals of Python and Java in my 
          spare time, and have since branched out into the world of Web Development and Machine Learning. In my most recent internship,
          I worked at Metrized Inc., a fast paced Machine Learning startup based in Vancouver.
          Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Physics at the University Of British Columbia, 
          where I am in my third year. When I'm not coding, you may find me making music, bouldering, running, skiing, or immersing myself in the beautiful nature surrounding Vancouver!
